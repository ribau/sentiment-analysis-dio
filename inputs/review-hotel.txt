Terrible service despite great location
Hotel Central, São Paulo, Brazil

The hotel is well located, right in the heart of the city, which is its only real advantage. The staff were unfriendly and seemed uninterested in helping. The room was not clean — hair on the sheets and stains on the carpet. Breakfast was cold and not fresh. The photos on the website are misleading.
